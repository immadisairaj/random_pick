A random picker

## What this app does

The application is split into two parts:

1. Numbers - It takes in two integer values __min__ _(inclusive)_ and __max__ _(inclusive)_, then returns a picked random number from the range.
2. List - It takes in a lit of any items, then returns a picked random item from the pool.
