## What this app does

The application has two functions as of now.

1. Numbers - It takes in two integer values __min__ _(inclusive)_ and __max__ _(inclusive)_, then returns a picked random number from the range.
2. List - It takes a list of items<sup>[1]</sup>, then returns a random item (picked) from the pool. The items inside the list can be (un)checked to include in the item pool.

<sup>[1]</sup>item: The item can be any string - a number, a name, a place, an animal, a thing, an object, etc.

## Motivation

As a Sri Sathya Sai Baba devotee, whenever struck somewhere, we have a habit of writing a few chits, putting them near Swamy and then picking one of the chits. We then blindly follow what is there in the chit as a command from Swamy.

Many people across the globe use the similar concept of picking randomly to decide something, which inspired me to create this application, in general, to solve the problem using an application that is handy and paper-free.
